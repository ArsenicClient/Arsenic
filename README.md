# Arsenic
**The client is as good as dead; don't ask for features or open up issues. They won't be addressed.**

Arsenic client is brought to you by Shitcode INC©.

# FYI

There are a lot of half implemented/finished things, I am no longer working on this so I thought that I might as well open source it.

The blatant things in the client are probably patched by now. However, all the ghost features should still work fine on most, if not all, servers.

## Looking at the code might cause severe brain-damage or insanity read at your own risk

## How To Build/Edit

- clone repo
- run setup.bat
- open Arsenic.ipr
- load gradle project
- skid away :D
