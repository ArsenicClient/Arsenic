# Arsenic

Arsenic is a 1.8.9 Minecraft cheat that specifically focuses on the Hypixel and Grim anti-cheat systems. Any features that trigger GrimAC should be removed or refactored. Arsenic is a Forge mod.

The client features:
- Module System
- Command System
- Custom Events
- Mixins

Currently, there are not too many modules; however, it is in a usable state, and most should bypass fine.
