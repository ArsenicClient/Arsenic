# Arsenic

Arsenic client is brought to you by Shitcode INCÂ©.

# FYI

There are a lot of half implemented/finished things, I am no longer working on this so I thought that I might as well open source it.

## Looking at the code might cause severe brain-damage or insanity read at your own risk

## How To Build/Edit
